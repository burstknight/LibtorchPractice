# simepleNet
This example demostracted how to create a neural network. This example use `struct` to create neural networks. However, we can define class to create neursl netowrk, but `struct` is simple. If you want to get more details of this example, you can see [this](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_frontend.html#module-api-basics).

## Usage
You can build this example by:
```bash
make clean
make
```

And then the executable file will exist in the directory `bin`, so you can use this command to run this example:
```bash
./bin/simpleNet/simpleNet
```
