# LibtorchPractice
This is my libtorch practice. All examples follow the [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_frontend.html#), so you can see the web to get more details of all examples.

Libtorch is C++ interface of Pytorch that is machine learning framework for Python. We can use libtorch to create neural network, like using PyTorch.

## Dependencies
In my examples, I use makefile and pkg-config to build code. You can use my another [repository](https://github.com/burstknight/InstallLibtorch) to install develop enviroment.

In the example `dcgan_struct`, it need `opencv` to convert the samples that are generated by GAN to images, so you must install `opencv`. You can follow bellow to install `opencv`:
```bash
# Install minimal prerequisites
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y cmake g++ wget unzip

# Download and unpack sources
wget -O opencv.zip https://github.com/opencv/opencv/archive/4.x.zip
unzip opencv.zip

# Create build directory
mkdir -p build && cd build

# Configure
cmake -DOPENCV_GENERATE_PKGCONFIG=ON ../opencv-4.x

# Build
make -j4

# Install
sudo make install

# Let computer load libs
sudo ldconfig -v
```

The command `make` can use `j<NUM>` to run muiltiple processes to build code in parallel, where `<NUM>` is the number of the processes to compile code.

## Build
If you want to debug code, you can follow:
```bash
make clean
make debug=1
```

Maybe you want to build all example for release. You can use these commands:
```bash
make clean
make
```

## Examples
I implemented three examples following this [web](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/advanced/cpp_frontend.html#). The examples are:
* [tensorEye](./tensorEye/Readme.md): It is a simple example that generates an identity matrix and show on terminal.
* [simpleNet](./simpleNet/Readme.md): It demostracted how to create a neural network by libtorch.
* [dcgan_struct](./dcgan_strurct/Readme.md): It used GAN to demostract how to create a program to train a network.
